  - ### About
     The [Indian Youth Red Cross][link-to-indian-yrc] is a voluntary humanitarian organization to protect human life and health based in India.

     It is a part of [International Red Cross][link-to-international-rc] and [Red Crescent Movement][link-to-rcm].

     We, at St. Joseph College of Engineering, are a part of the state level Youth Red Cross Society, run by Anna University. We are successfully fulfilling the duties of Red Cross since its inception in 2007.

     Our volunteer services include blood donation, medical camp, orphanage visits, old-age home visits, awareness camps and [much more][link-to-yrcsjce-website].

  - ### Objective
     The objective of Youth Red Cross is to _Serve for the needy_. To be updated.

  - ### High-level project scope
     The website aims to be a fully functional digital interface for YRC volunteers in SJCE and also to provide a medium to spread awareness for ethical practices and social welfare to the general public.

  - ### Target market
     As our propaganda is intrinsically non-profit driven, we don't encourage target/niche market. We provide voluntary services to the people in need, free of cost. The services are bound with the framework prescribed by Indian Youth Red Cross.
